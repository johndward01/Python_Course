# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# essentially.. tuples are list that cannot change

coordinates = (1, 2, 3)
# x = coordinates[0]
# y = coordinates[1]
# z = coordinates[2]
# This line is called UNPACKING and is shorthand for the above code
x, y, z = coordinates
